## 🎨 GUI Enhancements (COMPLETE)

### Island Challenges GUI
**File**: `IslandChallengesGUI.java`

**Visual Improvements**:
- Title: `⭐ Island Challenges ⭐` (bold gold)
- Gradient borders: Cyan → Light Blue → Cyan pattern
- Side borders for better containment
- Enhanced token display with:
  - Styled header: `✦ Island Tokens ✦` (aqua bold)
  - Strikethrough separators
  - Current balance: `X ⭐` (gold bold)
  - Three bullet points with green checkmarks
- Category items: `━━ 🌾 Farming ━━` format
- Enhanced back button with description

**Fixed**: ChallengeCategoryGUIListener now uses `.contains()` instead of `.equals()` for title matching

### Island Upgrades GUI
**File**: `IslandUpgradeGUI.java`

**Token Cost Integration**:
- All 5 upgrade types show both currencies:
  - ⛃ Units (yellow/green based on affordability)
  - ⭐ Island Tokens (yellow/green based on affordability)
- Color-coded display:
  - ✓ Green when player can afford
  - ✗ Red when player cannot afford
- Styled cost separator: `━━━ Cost ━━━`
- Separate error messages for each currency
- Currency info item with NETHER_STAR icon

## 💰 Token Economy System (COMPLETE)

### Token Costs (Balanced for Progression)

**Size Upgrades** (Progressive Fibonacci-like scaling):
```
Level 0-2:   1 token  ← Very affordable start
Level 3-4:   2 tokens
Level 5:     3 tokens
Level 6:     5 tokens
Level 7:     8 tokens
Level 8:     10 tokens
Level 9:     15 tokens
Level 10:    20 tokens
Level 11:    30 tokens
Level 12:    40 tokens
Level 13+:   50 tokens
```

**Player Limit Upgrades** (5 levels):
- Level 0: 5 tokens → Upgrade to 3 players
- Level 1: 10 tokens → Upgrade to 4 players
- Level 2: 20 tokens → Upgrade to 5 players
- Level 3: 30 tokens → Upgrade to 6 players
- Level 4: 50 tokens → Upgrade to 7 players

**Redstone Limit Upgrades** (5 levels):
- Level 0: 3 tokens → Upgrade to 15 items
- Level 1: 8 tokens → Upgrade to 20 items
- Level 2: 15 tokens → Upgrade to 25 items
- Level 3: 25 tokens → Upgrade to 30 items
- Level 4: 40 tokens → Upgrade to 35 items

**Crop Growth Upgrades** (5 levels):
- Level 0: 5 tokens → 1.25x speed
- Level 1: 12 tokens → 1.5x speed
- Level 2: 20 tokens → 1.75x speed
- Level 3: 30 tokens → 2.0x speed
- Level 4: 45 tokens → 2.5x speed

**Weather Control** (One-time):
- 50 tokens → Unlock /island weather commands

### Token Deduction Implementation

**File**: `IslandUpgradeManager.java`

**Pattern Applied to All 5 Upgrade Methods**:
```java
1. Calculate costs (both units and tokens)
2. Check if player has enough units
3. Check if island has enough tokens
4. Deduct both currencies
5. Apply upgrade
6. Save island
7. Return success message with costs shown
```

**Success Messages Include**:
- Old value → New value
- Units deducted: `-X units`
- Tokens deducted: `-Y tokens`

Example: `"Island size upgraded from 100x100 to 102x102! (1/249) [-1000 units, -1 tokens]"`

## 🤝 Island-Wide Challenges (COMPLETE)

**File**: `StarterChallenges.java`

**Changed to Island-Wide** (All members contribute):
- ✅ Farming - Plant Your First Crop
- ✅ Farming - Wheat Farmer (10 wheat)
- ✅ Farming - Agricultural Expert (64 wheat)
- ✅ Farming - Carrot Collector (32 carrots)
- ✅ Farming - Potato Master (128 potatoes)
- ✅ Farming - Animal Breeder (5 animals) - Already island-wide
- ✅ Building - All building challenges (already island-wide)
- ✅ Progression - All progression challenges (already island-wide)
- ✅ Social - All social challenges (already island-wide)
- ✅ Special - All special challenges (already island-wide)

- Combat challenges (zombies, skeletons, spiders, creepers, endermen)

**Reasoning**:

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Restart server after deploying new JAR
2. Grant yourself permission: `island.admin`
3. Create an island: `/island create`

### Test Sequence

#### 1. Test Admin Commands
```bash
# Give yourself tokens for testing
/islandadmin addtokens YourName 100

# Check island info
/islandadmin info YourName

# Set level for testing
/islandadmin setlevel YourName 10
```

#### 2. Test Challenge GUI
```bash
# Open challenges menu
/island challenges

# Click on "Farming" category
# Verify styled display and navigation
# Click "Back to Categories" → Should return to main menu
# Click "Back to Island Menu" → Should close to island menu
```

#### 3. Test Farming Challenges (Island-Wide)
```bash
# Invite a friend to your island
/island invite FriendName

# Have friend accept
# Friend: /island accept YourName

# Both players harvest wheat
# Progress should combine (island-wide)
```

#### 4. Test Upgrade Purchases
```bash
# Give yourself units
/currency give YourName 100000 units

# Give yourself tokens
/islandadmin addtokens YourName 50

# Open upgrades menu
/island upgrades

# Try size upgrade (should show green ✓ for both currencies)
# Click to purchase
# Verify: Units deducted, tokens deducted, size increased

# Try with insufficient tokens
/islandadmin settokens YourName 0
# Click size upgrade
# Expected: Error message "You need 1 island tokens..."
```

#### 5. Test Token Cost Display
```bash
# Set tokens to 0
/islandadmin settokens YourName 0

# Open /island upgrades
# All upgrades should show red ✗ for tokens
# Hover over upgrade items
# Should see: "✗ Not enough tokens!"

# Add tokens
/islandadmin addtokens YourName 100

# Reopen /island upgrades
# Upgrades should show green ✓ for tokens (if you have units too)
```

#### 6. Test Progressive Costs
```bash
# Start fresh
/islandadmin settokens YourName 1000
/currency give YourName 1000000 units

# Buy size upgrades multiple times
# Level 0→1: 1 token
# Level 1→2: 1 token
# Level 2→3: 1 token
# Level 3→4: 2 tokens
# Verify costs increase as documented
```

- ✅ Token costs match between display and actual deduction
- ✅ Farming challenges progress for all island members
- ✅ Error messages clear and helpful
- ✅ Success messages show both costs deducted
