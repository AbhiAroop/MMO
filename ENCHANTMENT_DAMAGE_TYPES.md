# Enchantment Damage Type System

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive damage type system for enchantments that distinguishes between **Physical Damage** and **Magical Damage** based on element types, with proper damage reduction calculations for player vs player combat.

## Damage Type Classification

### Physical Damage Elements
Elements that deal physical damage (reduced by **Armor** stat):
- üî• **Fire** - Physical burning and combustion damage
- üíß **Water** - Physical water pressure and force
- ‚õ∞ **Earth** - Physical earth and stone impact
- üí® **Air** - Physical wind and pressure damage
- üåø **Nature** - Physical plant and nature damage

### Magical Damage Elements
Elements that deal magical damage (reduced by **Magic Resist** stat):
- ‚ö° **Lightning** - Magical electrical energy
- üåë **Shadow** - Magical dark energy
- ‚ú® **Light** - Magical radiant energy

## Damage Reduction Formula

The system uses a diminishing returns formula for damage reduction:

```
Final Damage = Raw Damage √ó (100 / (100 + Defense Stat))
```

### Damage Reduction Examples:

| Defense Stat | Damage Reduction | Example: 10 Raw Damage |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 0            | 0%               | 10.0 damage            |
| 10           | 9.1%             | 9.1 damage             |
| 25           | 20.0%            | 8.0 damage             |
| 50           | 33.3%            | 6.7 damage             |
| 100          | 50.0%            | 5.0 damage             |
| 200          | 66.7%            | 3.3 damage             |
| 300          | 75.0%            | 2.5 damage             |

**Key Points:**
- No damage reduction cap (can exceed 75%)
- Diminishing returns prevent immunity
- Balanced for PvP combat
- Armor reduces physical enchantment damage
- Magic Resist reduces magical enchantment damage

## Implementation

### New Utility Class: `EnchantmentDamageUtil`

Located at: `com.server.enchantments.utils.EnchantmentDamageUtil`

#### Key Methods:

**1. `isPhysicalDamage(ElementType element)`**
```java
// Returns true for Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Nature
// Returns false for Lightning, Shadow, Light
```

**2. `calculateReducedDamage(double rawDamage, Player target, ElementType element)`**
```java
// Calculates damage after applying appropriate defense stat
// Automatically selects Armor or Magic Resist based on element type
```

**3. `applyEnchantmentDamage(double rawDamage, Player target, ElementType element)`**
```java
// Applies damage directly to player's health
// Returns actual damage dealt after reduction
```

**4. `getDamageTypeName(ElementType element)`**
```java
// Returns "Physical" or "Magical" for display
```

**5. `getDefenseStatName(ElementType element)`**
```java
// Returns "Armor" or "Magic Resist" for display
```

**6. `getDamageReductionPercent(Player target, ElementType element)`**
```java
// Returns damage reduction percentage (0.0 to 1.0) for display
```

## Updated Enchantments

### InfernoStrike (Fire - Physical Damage)

**Changes:**
- Now applies physical damage with armor reduction for player targets
- Non-player targets use vanilla damage system (unchanged)
- Displays actual damage dealt after armor reduction

**Code Example:**
```java
if (target instanceof Player) {
    // For player targets, apply damage with armor reduction (Fire = Physical)
    double actualDamage = EnchantmentDamageUtil.applyEnchantmentDamage(
        bonusDamage, (Player) target, getElement()
    );
    
    player.sendMessage(getColoredName() + " dealt +" + 
                      String.format("%.1f", actualDamage) + " physical fire damage!");
} else {
    // For non-player targets, use vanilla damage system
    damageEvent.setDamage(currentDamage + bonusDamage);
}
```

### EmberVeil (Fire - Indirect Damage)

**Status:** No changes needed
- Sets attackers on fire using Minecraft's fire tick system
- Minecraft's built-in fire damage already respects armor
- Proper damage type automatically applied

### Frostflow (Water - Crowd Control)

**Status:** No changes needed
- Only applies crowd control effects (slowness)
- Does not deal direct damage
- No damage reduction needed

## Usage Examples

### Testing Physical vs Magical Damage:

**Test 1: High Armor vs Fire Damage**
```bash
# Give target player high armor
/adminstats @target armor 100

# Attack with InfernoStrike (Fire = Physical)
/enchant add infernostrike LEGENDARY 5

# Expected: ~50% damage reduction from armor
# Raw 17 damage ‚Üí ~8.5 actual damage
```

**Test 2: High Magic Resist vs Lightning Damage**
```bash
# Give target player high magic resist
/adminstats @target magic_resist 100

# Attack with future Lightning enchantment (Magical)
# Expected: ~50% damage reduction from magic resist

# Attack with InfernoStrike (Fire = Physical)
# Expected: No reduction (magic resist doesn't affect physical)
```

**Test 3: Tank Build vs Mage Build**
```bash
# Tank (High Armor, Low Magic Resist)
/adminstats @target armor 200
/adminstats @target magic_resist 10

# Mage (High Magic Resist, Low Armor)
/adminstats @p armor 10
/adminstats @p magic_resist 200

# Tank takes reduced physical enchantment damage (Fire/Water/Earth/Air/Nature)
# Mage takes reduced magical enchantment damage (Lightning/Shadow/Light)
```

## Strategic Implications

### Meta Build Considerations:

**1. Physical Defense Build (Tank)**
- Stack Armor stat
- Counters: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Nature enchantments
- Weak to: Lightning, Shadow, Light enchantments

**2. Magical Defense Build (Mage Killer)**
- Stack Magic Resist stat
- Counters: Lightning, Shadow, Light enchantments
- Weak to: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Nature enchantments

**3. Balanced Build**
- Split between Armor and Magic Resist
- No hard counters
- Moderate defense against all element types

**4. Glass Cannon Build**
- Minimal defensive stats
- Maximize offensive stats
- High risk, high reward

### Enchantment Damage Type Strategy:

**Current Enchantments:**
- ‚úÖ **InfernoStrike** (Fire): Physical damage ‚Üí Countered by Armor
- ‚úÖ **EmberVeil** (Fire): Indirect fire damage ‚Üí Affected by Armor
- ‚úÖ **Frostflow** (Water): Crowd control only ‚Üí No direct damage

**Future Enchantments Should Consider:**
- Lightning enchantments: Magical damage ‚Üí Countered by Magic Resist
- Shadow enchantments: Magical damage ‚Üí Countered by Magic Resist
- Light enchantments: Magical damage ‚Üí Countered by Magic Resist
- Earth/Air/Nature: Physical damage ‚Üí Countered by Armor

## Technical Details

### Profile System Integration:
- Retrieves active player profile via `ProfileManager.getActiveProfile(UUID)`
- Gets profile stats via `PlayerProfile.getStats()`
- Accesses defense stats: `stats.getArmor()` and `stats.getMagicResist()`

### Null Safety:
- Handles players without profiles (returns raw damage)
- Handles players without active profiles (returns raw damage)
- Graceful degradation ensures no crashes

### Performance Considerations:
- Calculations only performed when damage is dealt
- No continuous tracking or polling
- Minimal overhead per damage event

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. **Elemental Armor Pieces** - Armor that provides bonus defense against specific elements
2. **Penetration Stats** - Physical Penetration and Magic Penetration to counter high defense
3. **True Damage** - Hybrid element damage type that ignores all defense stats
4. **Adaptive Damage** - Enchantments that automatically deal physical or magical based on target's weakest defense
5. **Damage Type Indicators** - Visual particles/colors to show physical (red) vs magical (blue) damage

### Compatibility:
- System designed for easy expansion to hybrid elements (Ice, Storm, Lava)
- Supports future enchantments with mixed damage types
- Extensible for custom damage formulas per enchantment
