# Sea Monster Affinity - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new fishing stat called "Sea Monster Affinity" that multiplicatively increases the chance of fishing up mobs.

## Key Features
- **Uncapped percentage stat**: Players can stack as much as they want
- **Multiplicative bonus**: 100% affinity = 2x mob spawn chance (8% → 16%)
- **Works with custom items/armor**: Scans for "Sea Monster Affinity:" in item lore
- **Integrated into all systems**: Stats GUI, admin commands, stat scanning

## Technical Details

### Formula
```
mobChance = 0.08 * (1.0 - (luckBonus * 0.5)) * (1.0 + (seaMonsterAffinity / 100.0))
```

**Examples:**
- 0% affinity = 1.0x multiplier (8% base chance)
- 50% affinity = 1.5x multiplier (12% base chance)
- 100% affinity = 2.0x multiplier (16% base chance)
- 200% affinity = 3.0x multiplier (24% base chance)

### Files Modified

#### 1. PlayerStats.java
- **Line 44**: Added `private double seaMonsterAffinity;` field
- **Line 94**: Added `private double defaultSeaMonsterAffinity = 0.0;` default value
- **Line 144**: Added initialization in `resetToDefaults()`
- **Line 231-232**: Added getter and setter methods
- **Line 412-414**: Added default getter method

- **Line 1020**: Added application of bonuses to player stats

#### 3. StatsGUI.java
- **Lines 372-375**: Added Sea Monster Affinity display to Fishing Stats section
- **Lines 755-762**: Added `getSeaMonsterAffinityDescription()` helper method
  - Shows "No bonus" at 0%
  - Shows "X.Xx mob spawn chance" for values > 0%

#### 4. AdminStatsCommand.java
- **Line 69**: Registered "seamonsteraffinity" in availableStats map
- **Lines 343-345**: Added to stats view display

  - Passes it to FishingMob.trySpawnMob()

## How It Works

### 1. Stat Scanning (Custom Items/Armor)
When a player equips an item with lore like:
```
Sea Monster Affinity: +50%
```
StatScanManager will:
1. Extract the value (50.0)
2. Add it to ItemStatBonuses.seaMonsterAffinity
3. Apply total bonus to PlayerStats via `setSeaMonsterAffinity()`

### 2. Fishing Process
When a player catches a fish:
1. FishingListener gets player's seaMonsterAffinity value
2. Passes it to FishingMob.trySpawnMob() along with fishingType and luckBonus
3. FishingMob calculates final spawn chance using formula
4. Rolls random to determine if mob spawns
5. If spawned, mob is hooked to fishing rod

### 3. Display in GUI
Players can view their Sea Monster Affinity in `/stats`:
- Shows percentage value (e.g., "50.0%")
- Shows calculated multiplier (e.g., "1.5x mob spawn chance")

### 4. Admin Commands
Admins can modify Sea Monster Affinity using `/adminstats`:
```
/adminstats <player> set seamonsteraffinity <value>
/adminstats <player> add seamonsteraffinity <value>
/adminstats <player> view
```

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Basic Functionality
- Create test item with "Sea Monster Affinity: +100%"
- Equip item and fish
- Verify mobs spawn approximately 2x more often

### 2. Stat Stacking
- Create multiple items with Sea Monster Affinity
- Equip all items
- Verify values stack additively (100% + 50% = 150% = 2.5x multiplier)

### 3. GUI Display
- Open `/stats` with 0% affinity → Should show "No bonus"
- Equip item with affinity → Should show correct multiplier

### 4. Admin Commands
- Use `/adminstats` to set default value
- Verify player spawns with new default
- Test add/set commands

### 5. Edge Cases
- Very high values (500%+ = 6x multiplier)
- Negative values (should be clamped to 0 by setter)
- Fractional values (50.5%)

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Compatible With:
- **Luck**: Reduces mob chance (counteracts affinity)
- **Custom Items**: Can add affinity via item lore
- **Custom Armor**: Can add affinity via armor lore
- **Admin Commands**: Can set default values
- **Stat Scanning**: Automatically detects in equipment

### Independent From:
- **Treasure Bonus**: Only affects treasure/junk drops
- **Fishing Fortune**: Only affects fish quality
- **Other Fishing Stats**: Lure Potency, Resilience, Focus, Precision

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Features:
1. **Custom Items**: Create fishing gear with Sea Monster Affinity
   - "Aquatic Hunter's Rod" (+50% Sea Monster Affinity)
   - "Deep Sea Explorer's Armor" (+25% per piece)

2. **Skill Tree Nodes**: Add nodes that grant Sea Monster Affinity
   - "Monster Hunter" node: +20% affinity
   - "Leviathan's Call" node: +50% affinity

3. **Consumable Buffs**: Potions/foods that grant temporary affinity
   - "Monster Bait" potion: +100% for 5 minutes
   - "Chum Bucket" food: +50% for 10 minutes

4. **Achievements**: Reward players for fishing up mobs
   - "Monster Hunter" (100 mobs): +10% affinity
   - "Sea Monster Slayer" (1000 mobs): +25% affinity
