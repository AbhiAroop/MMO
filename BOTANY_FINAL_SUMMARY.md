## 🎮 Quick Start Guide

### Get Your First Seeds:
```bash
/botany give YourName golden_wheat 16
```

### Plant a Crop:
1. Right-click farmland with seed
2. Watch ItemDisplay entity appear
3. Wait ~2 minutes for growth
4. Break to harvest!

### Build a Breeder:
```
Place 3x3 farmland with composter in center:
F F F
F C F    (F = Farmland, C = Composter)
F F F
```

### Start Breeding:
1. Hold 2 Golden Wheat seeds
2. Right-click composter
3. Wait ~1 minute
4. Get Crimson Carrot seed (60% chance)!

## 📊 System Features

### ✨ Implemented Features:
- ✅ 6 custom crops with progression system
- ✅ Time-based growth (4-8 stages per crop)
- ✅ Level requirements (1 → 75)
- ✅ XP rewards (plant, harvest, breed)

---

## 🎨 Resource Pack Required

Players will see **wheat seeds** until you create the resource pack. See **BOTANY_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md** for complete instructions.

**Quick Summary:**
- Create 58 custom model JSON files
- Create 58 texture PNG files (16x16)
- Use Custom Model Data range: 100001-100058
- Distribute to players

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

1. **Start Server**: Check console for "[Botany] initialized successfully!"
2. **Give Seeds**: `/botany give YourName golden_wheat 10`
3. **Plant**: Right-click farmland with seed
4. **Check Growth**: Wait 2 minutes, should update through 4 stages
5. **Harvest**: Break fully grown crop, get 2-4 items + XP
6. **Check Stats**: `/botany info` should show 1 crop harvested
7. **Build Breeder**: Make 3x3 farmland + center composter
8. **Breed**: Right-click with 2 seeds, wait ~1 minute
9. **Result**: Get Crimson Carrot seed (60% chance)
