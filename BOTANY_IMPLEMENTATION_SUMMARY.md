## üî® What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Resource Pack Creation
Follow the guide in `BOTANY_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` to create:
- Modify `wheat_seeds.json` with custom model data overrides
- Create individual crop model JSONs (30+ files)
- Create crop textures (30+ PNG files)
- Test in-game

**Quick Start Template** (for testing):
Use placeholder textures initially - copy wheat/carrot textures and tint them different colors:
- Golden Wheat = yellow tint
- Crimson Carrot = red tint
- Ender Berry = purple tint
- Crystal Melon = cyan tint
- Celestial Potato = white/glowing
- Void Pumpkin = dark purple/black

### 2. Complete BotanySubskill Integration

#### A. Update BotanySubskill.java
The stub exists, but you need to add:
```java
- Methods to check player Botany level
- XP gain integration
- Skill tree nodes for:
  * Unlock breeding recipes
  * Faster growth speed
  * Higher seed drop chances
  * Breeding success rate bonuses
- Rewards (farming fortune, growth speed boosts, etc.)
```

#### B. Create BotanyListener.java
Handle player interactions:
```java
- PlayerInteractEvent: Plant custom crops on farmland
- BlockBreakEvent: Harvest custom crops, give drops + XP
- PlayerInteractEvent: Right-click breeder with seeds to start breeding
```

#### C. Create BotanyManager.java
Background systems:
```java
- Growth tick task (runs every X seconds)
- Iterate all planted crops, call tryGrow()
- Save/load planted crop data to MongoDB
- Track breeder structures
- Update breeding progress
```

#### D. Register with SkillRegistry
Add Botany to the skill system so it shows in GUIs and gains XP properly.

### 3. Create Command Interface

Create `/botany` command for:
- `/botany give <player> <cropId>` - Give custom crop seeds
- `/botany info` - Show planted crops and breeders nearby
- `/botany reload` - Reload crop registry
- `/botany breed <crop1> <crop2>` - Manual breeding test

### 4. Skill Tree Integration

Add Botany nodes to farming skill tree:
- **Early Nodes** (Level 1-20):
  * Unlock Golden Wheat breeding
  * +5% growth speed
  * +2% seed drop chance
  
- **Mid Nodes** (Level 20-50):
  * Unlock Crimson Carrot, Ender Berry, Crystal Melon
  * +10% growth speed
  * +5% seed drop chance
  * +10% breeding success rate
  
- **Late Nodes** (Level 50-100):
  * Unlock Celestial Potato, Void Pumpkin
  * +20% growth speed
  * +10% seed drop chance
  * +25% breeding success rate
  * Unlock crop mutations

### 5. Testing Checklist

Once implemented:
- [ ] Plant Golden Wheat seed on farmland
- [ ] Wait for growth through all stages
- [ ] Harvest and receive drops + XP
- [ ] Build breeder structure
- [ ] Place two seeds in breeder
- [ ] Wait for breeding completion
- [ ] Receive new crop seed
- [ ] Verify XP awards correctly
- [ ] Test with Bedrock players (tripwire + display entities)
- [ ] Verify persistence (restart server, crops still there)

## üéÆ Player Experience Flow

1. **Discovery**: Player unlocks Botany at Farming level 20 (or via skill tree)
2. **First Crop**: Given starter Golden Wheat seed or finds via quest/reward
3. **Plant & Grow**: Places on farmland, watches ItemDisplay entity show growth
4. **Harvest**: Breaks crop, gets wheat + potential seed back + XP
5. **Build Breeder**: Creates 3x3 farmland + composter structure
6. **First Breed**: Combines two Golden Wheat seeds ‚Üí 60% chance Crimson Carrot
7. **Progression**: Works up rarity ladder, each requiring higher Botany level
8. **Mastery**: Level 75+ players can breed Void Pumpkins (Mythic tier)

## üîß Technical Notes

### Block State Choice: Tripwire
- **Pros**: 
  * Invisible block with collision
  * Doesn't require block states (unlimited crops possible)
  * No lighting updates
- **Cons**:
  * Players can see in F3 debug
  * Can be triggered by entities walking over (disable in listener)

### Visual System: ItemDisplay
- **Pros**:
  * Full control over positioning, rotation, scale
  * Supports any item model
  * Smooth updates
- **Cons**:
  * Entity overhead (mitigated by chunk unloading)
  * Requires 1.19.4+ 

### Growth System
- Passive growth every X seconds (configurable)
- NOT tick-based (too expensive)
- Growth stored as timestamp + stage
- Check elapsed time vs required time per stage

### Breeding System
- Not instant (timed process)
- Visual feedback during breeding
- Success based on recipe chance + Botany level
- Can fail if level too low

## üìà Balancing Considerations

### Growth Times
Current values are placeholders. Adjust based on playtesting:
- Common: 2 minutes (fast, starter crop)
- Uncommon: 3 minutes
- Rare: 4 minutes
- Epic: 6 minutes
- Legendary: 9 minutes
- Mythic: 13 minutes

### XP Values
Scale with rarity. Breeding gives most XP (reward for effort):
- Planting: 10-300 XP
- Harvesting: 15-500 XP  
- Breeding: 25-1000 XP

### Seed Drop Rates
Lower for rarer crops (makes breeding essential):
- Common: 15%
- Uncommon: 12%
- Rare: 10%
- Epic: 8%
- Legendary: 5%
- Mythic: 2%

### Breeding Success Rates
Adjust to control progression speed:
- Common ‚Üí Uncommon: 60%
- Uncommon ‚Üí Rare: 40%
- Rare ‚Üí Epic: 30%
- Epic ‚Üí Legendary: 20%
- Legendary ‚Üí Mythic: 10%

Players can boost these with Botany skill tree nodes!

## üöÄ Future Expansion Ideas

### More Crops
- Elemental crops (fire, water, earth, air themed)
- Seasonal crops (only plantable in certain months)
- Mob drops as "seeds" (zombie flesh ‚Üí undead wheat)

### Advanced Mechanics
- **Crop Quality**: Roll quality on harvest (affects drops/XP)
- **Fertilizers**: Craftable items to boost growth/quality
- **Diseases**: Random chance for crops to get sick (need cure)
- **Greenhouse**: Multiblock for faster growth indoors
- **Auto-Harvester**: Multiblock that auto-harvests when mature
- **Sprinkler**: Multiblock that waters crops in radius

### Integration
- **Alchemy**: Custom crops as potion ingredients
- **Cooking**: Custom crops for unique recipes
- **Quests**: "Breed 10 Ender Berries" objectives
- **Achievements**: "Master Botanist" for breeding all crops
