# Island Token Deduction System - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented **token checking and deduction logic** for all 5 island upgrade types. Players must now have both **Units** AND **Island Tokens** to purchase upgrades.

---

## Token Cost Formula (Balanced)

### Size Upgrades
Progressive scaling for better early-game progression:
```
Level 0-2:  1 token  (very affordable start)
Level 3-4:  2 tokens
Level 5:    3 tokens
Level 6:    5 tokens
Level 7:    8 tokens
Level 8:    10 tokens
Level 9:    15 tokens
Level 10:   20 tokens
Level 11:   30 tokens
Level 12:   40 tokens
Level 13+:  50 tokens
```

### Player Limit Upgrades
5 levels available:
```
Level 0: 5 tokens
Level 1: 10 tokens
Level 2: 20 tokens
Level 3: 30 tokens
Level 4: 50 tokens
```

### Redstone Limit Upgrades
5 levels available:
```
Level 0: 3 tokens
Level 1: 8 tokens
Level 2: 15 tokens
Level 3: 25 tokens
Level 4: 40 tokens
```

### Crop Growth Upgrades
5 levels available:
```
Level 0: 5 tokens
Level 1: 12 tokens
Level 2: 20 tokens
Level 3: 30 tokens
Level 4: 45 tokens
```

### Weather Control
One-time purchase:
```
50 tokens (flat rate)
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. **IslandUpgradeManager.java**

Added **calculateTokenCost()** helper method (lines 24-59):
```java
private static int calculateTokenCost(String upgradeType, int currentLevel) {
    switch (upgradeType.toLowerCase()) {
        case "size": // Progressive scaling
        case "player_limit": // Linear scaling: 5 + (level * 5)
        case "redstone": // Specific costs per level
        case "crop_growth": // Specific costs per level
        case "weather": // Flat 50 tokens
    }
}
```

**Updated all 5 upgrade methods:**

1. **upgradeSizeLevel()** (lines 67-109)
   - Checks unit cost first
   - Then checks token cost
   - Deducts both if affordable
   - Returns success message with costs shown

2. **upgradePlayerLimit()** (lines 113-160)
   - Same pattern as size upgrade
   - Shows both costs in success message

3. **upgradeRedstoneLimit()** (lines 164-213)
   - Validates token requirement
   - Deducts tokens after units
   - Shows updated limits and costs

4. **upgradeCropGrowth()** (lines 217-264)
   - Checks both currencies
   - Updates multiplier after payment
   - Displays costs deducted

5. **enableWeatherControl()** (lines 268-315)
   - One-time 50 token cost
   - Validates before enabling
   - Confirms purchase with costs

**Pattern Applied to Each Method:**
```java
// 1. Calculate costs
int unitCost = island.getXUpgradeCost();
int tokenCost = calculateTokenCost("type", currentLevel);

// 2. Check unit affordability
if (profile == null || profile.getUnits() < unitCost) {
    return new UpgradeResult(false, "Need X units!");
}

// 3. Check token affordability
if (island.getIslandTokens() < tokenCost) {
    return new UpgradeResult(false, "Need X tokens!");
}

// 4. Deduct both costs
profile.removeUnits(unitCost);
island.removeIslandTokens(tokenCost);

// 5. Apply upgrade and save
// ... upgrade logic ...
island.save();

// 6. Return success with costs shown
return new UpgradeResult(true, "Success! [-X units, -Y tokens]");
```

## GUI Display (Already Complete)

**IslandUpgradeGUI.java** already displays token costs with:
- ✅ Dual currency display (⛃ Units + ⭐ Tokens)
- ✅ Color-coded affordability (green=can afford, red=cannot)
- ✅ Separate error messages for each currency
- ✅ Styled separators "━━━ Cost ━━━"
- ✅ Helpful tooltips

Example display:
```
━━━ Cost ━━━
⛃ 1000 Units ✓ (green if you have enough)
⭐ 5 Island Tokens ✓ (green if you have enough)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Testing Setup
1. Build the project: `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
2. Copy `target/mmo-0.0.1.jar` to server plugins folder
3. Restart server
4. Give yourself test resources: `/units add <player> 100000`
5. Give yourself test tokens using island admin command (pending implementation)

### Test Cases

#### Test 1: Size Upgrade with Sufficient Resources
```
1. Player has 10,000 units and 10 tokens
2. Open /island upgrades
3. Click size upgrade (Level 0 -> 1, costs 1000 units + 1 token)
4. Expected: Upgrade succeeds, shows "[-1000 units, -1 tokens]"
5. Verify: Island size increased, units decreased, tokens decreased
```

#### Test 2: Size Upgrade with Insufficient Units
```
1. Player has 500 units and 10 tokens
2. Try to upgrade (costs 1000 units + 1 token)
3. Expected: Error "You need 1000 units to upgrade! (You have 500)"
4. Verify: No changes made
```

#### Test 3: Size Upgrade with Insufficient Tokens
```
1. Player has 10,000 units and 0 tokens
2. Try to upgrade (costs 1000 units + 1 token)
3. Expected: Error "You need 1 island tokens to upgrade! (You have 0)"
4. Verify: No units deducted
```

#### Test 4: Progressive Token Costs
```
1. Upgrade size from level 0 -> 1 (1 token)
2. Upgrade size from level 1 -> 2 (1 token)
3. Upgrade size from level 2 -> 3 (1 token)
4. Upgrade size from level 3 -> 4 (2 tokens)
5. Upgrade size from level 4 -> 5 (2 tokens)
6. Verify: Costs increase as expected
```

#### Test 5: Player Limit Upgrade
```
1. Player has sufficient units and 5 tokens
2. Upgrade player limit (Level 0 -> 1)
3. Expected: Success, limit increases from 2 to 3 players
4. Verify: 5 tokens deducted, units deducted
```

#### Test 6: Weather Control Purchase
```
1. Player has 50,000 units and 50 tokens
2. Click weather control upgrade
3. Expected: Success, weather control enabled
4. Verify: 50 tokens + 50,000 units deducted
5. Try to purchase again
6. Expected: Error "You already have weather control!"
```

#### Test 7: Island Token Balance Display
```
1. Open /island challenges menu
2. Verify token balance shown with ⭐ symbol
3. Complete a challenge
4. Reopen menu, verify token count increased
```

#### Test 8: All Upgrade Types
```
Test each upgrade type:
- Size: Verify progressive scaling works
- Player Limit: Test all 5 levels
- Redstone: Test all 5 levels
- Crop Growth: Test all 5 levels
- Weather: Test one-time purchase
```

## Error Handling

All upgrade methods now properly handle:

1. **Missing Island**: "You don't have an island!"
2. **Max Level**: Type-specific max level messages
3. **Insufficient Units**: Shows required vs current units
4. **Insufficient Tokens**: Shows required vs current tokens
5. **Success**: Shows old value, new value, and costs deducted

Example error messages:
- ❌ "You need 1000 units to upgrade! (You have 500)"
- ❌ "You need 5 island tokens to upgrade! (You have 2)"
- ✅ "Island size upgraded from 100x100 to 102x102! (1/249) [-1000 units, -1 tokens]"

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Island-Wide Challenges
Make appropriate challenges shared among island members:
- **Should be island-wide**: Building, farming, progression challenges
- **Should remain individual**: Combat, mining, crafting challenges

File to modify: `StarterChallenges.java`
Change: `.isIslandWide(false)` to `.isIslandWide(true)` for relevant challenges

### 2. Create Admin Island Command
Create `/islandadmin` command with GUI options:
- Set island tokens (input amount)
- Set island level (input level)
- Set island value (input value)
- Auto-complete challenge (select challenge)
- Set upgrade level (select type, input level)
- View island stats

Files to create:
- `IslandAdminCommand.java`
- `IslandAdminGUI.java`

Register in:
- `Main.java` - Command registration
- `plugin.yml` - Command definition with permissions

### 3. Balance Testing
With admin tools, test:
- Challenge completion rates
- Token earning speed
- Upgrade progression curve
- Player feedback on costs
- Early game vs late game balance

### 4. Final Polish
- Add sounds to upgrade purchases
- Particle effects for successful upgrades
- Confirmation dialog for expensive upgrades
- Upgrade history/log for islands

## Technical Notes

### Cost Calculation Consistency
- **IslandUpgradeGUI.calculateTokenCost()** - Used for DISPLAY
- **IslandUpgradeManager.calculateTokenCost()** - Used for LOGIC
- Both methods are **identical** to ensure display matches actual costs

### Thread Safety
All upgrade operations use `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` for async execution, preventing server lag during:
- Database saves
- World border updates
- Cost validation

### Database Integration
Token deduction uses existing `PlayerIsland` methods:
- `getIslandTokens()` - Get current balance
- `removeIslandTokens(int)` - Deduct tokens
- `addIslandTokens(int)` - Award tokens (from challenges)
- Changes are saved via `IslandDataManager.saveIsland()`

| Size Lvl 3  | 30               | 2                 | 93%       |
| Size Lvl 5  | 50               | 3                 | 94%       |
| Player Limit| 10-100           | 5-50              | 50%       |
| Redstone    | 15-120           | 3-40              | 67%       |
| Crop Growth | 20-150           | 5-45              | 70%       |
| Weather     | 100              | 50                | 50%       |

**Result**: Much more accessible for early game, still requires effort for late game.
