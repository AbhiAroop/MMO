# Anvil GUI Animation Revert

## Overview
This document details the reversion of animation features from the Anvil GUI while keeping the animation system for the Enchantment GUI.

---

## Changes Made

### AnvilGUIListener.java - Reverted to Pre-Animation State

#### 1. **Removed Imports**
- ❌ Removed `import com.server.enchantments.gui.GUIAnimationHandler;`
- ❌ Removed `import com.server.enchantments.effects.ElementalParticles;`
- ❌ Removed `import com.server.enchantments.elements.ElementType;`
- ❌ Removed `import de.tr7zw.changeme.nbtapi.NBTItem;`

These imports were only needed for the animation system and particle effects.

#### 2. **Output Slot Click Handler - Simplified**
**Before**: Complex logic with animation skip checks, preview clearing, and animation frame detection
**After**: Simple direct interaction
- Preview click gives message and triggers `handleCombine()`
- Result item taken directly by player
- No animation frames or skipping needed

```java
// Check if it's a preview placeholder (can't take it directly)
if (current.getType() == Material.LIME_STAINED_GLASS_PANE || 
    current.getType() == Material.RED_STAINED_GLASS_PANE) {
    // This is a preview - can't take directly, must confirm combine
    player.sendMessage(ChatColor.YELLOW + "⚠ This is a preview! Click again to confirm combination.");
    player.playSound(player.getLocation(), org.bukkit.Sound.BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_PLING, 0.5f, 1.5f);
    
    // Trigger the combine
    handleCombine(player, gui);
    return;
}

// It's an actual result item - give to player
```

#### 3. **handleCombine() Method - Direct Result**
**Before**: 
- Consumed inputs
- Started animation
- Result shown after 2 seconds
- Particle effects on completion

**After**:
- Consumes inputs immediately
- Sets result in output slot **instantly**
- Plays success sound
- No animation or particle effects

```java
// Get the result
ItemStack cleanResult = actualResult.getResult();

// Consume input items
// ... (consumption code)

// Clear GUI state and set the result in output slot
gui.clearInputs();
gui.getInventory().setItem(AnvilGUI.OUTPUT_SLOT, cleanResult);

// Send success message
// ...

// Play success sound
player.playSound(player.getLocation(), org.bukkit.Sound.ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP, 1.0f, 1.0f);

// Sync GUI
// ...
```

#### 4. **onInventoryClose() Method - Removed Animation Handling**
**Before**: 
- Checked for active animation
- Cancelled animation and gave result to player
- Cleared output slot to prevent glass pane return

**After**:
- Simple item return (inputs only)
- No animation checking or cancellation
- No special output slot handling

```java
// Double-check this is actually our GUI by title (prevents conflicts with other GUIs)
String title = event.getView().getTitle();
if (!title.contains("Custom Anvil")) {
    return;
}

// Return items to player
ItemStack input1 = gui.getInventory().getItem(AnvilGUI.INPUT_SLOT_1);
ItemStack input2 = gui.getInventory().getItem(AnvilGUI.INPUT_SLOT_2);
// ...
```

#### 5. **Kept Title Check Fix**
The title check to prevent GUI conflicts was **kept** as it's a necessary fix regardless of animations:

```java
// Double-check this is actually our GUI by title (prevents conflicts with other GUIs)
String title = event.getView().getTitle();
if (!title.contains("Custom Anvil")) {
    return;
}
```

## EnchantmentGUIListener.java - KEPT ALL CHANGES

The enchantment GUI **keeps all animation features** including:
- ✅ Animation glass panes
- ✅ 2-second animation sequence
- ✅ Skip functionality (click or close)
- ✅ Output slot clearing fix (prevents glass pane duplication)
- ✅ Title check fix (prevents GUI conflicts)

---

## Behavior Comparison

### Anvil GUI (After Revert)

#### Previous (With Animation):
1. Player places items → Preview shown
2. Player clicks preview → Preview cleared → Animation starts
3. Animation plays for 2 seconds
4. Result appears in output slot
5. Player takes result

#### Current (Reverted):
1. Player places items → Preview shown
2. Player clicks preview → `handleCombine()` triggered
3. Inputs consumed, costs deducted
4. **Result appears immediately** in output slot
5. Player takes result

### Enchantment GUI (Unchanged)

#### Flow (Still Has Animation):
1. Player places item + fragments + tome
2. Player clicks confirm → Animation starts
3. Animation plays for 2 seconds with colored glass panes
4. Result appears after animation
5. Player takes result or closes GUI to skip

## Technical Details

### Anvil GUI Flow (Current)

```
Player clicks preview
    ↓
handleCombine() called
    ↓
Check costs (XP, essence)
    ↓
Consume costs
    ↓
Consume input items
    ↓
Set result in output slot IMMEDIATELY
    ↓
Play success sound + message
    ↓
Player can take result
```

### Why This Works Better

1. **No Duplication Issues**: Result set directly after consumption
2. **No Preview Confusion**: Preview distinct from result (glass vs item)
3. **Instant Feedback**: Player sees result immediately
4. **No GUI Conflicts**: Title checks prevent wrong listener processing
5. **Simpler Code**: Fewer edge cases and state management

## Removed Features from Anvil GUI

- ❌ 2-second animation sequence
- ❌ Colored glass pane frames
- ❌ Animation skip functionality
- ❌ Animation state tracking

---

## Kept Features

---

## Files Modified

**Type**: Revert to pre-animation state + title check fix
**Compilation**: ✅ No errors (only warnings)

### EnchantmentGUIListener.java
**Lines Changed**: 0 (all changes kept)
**Type**: No changes
**Status**: Animation system intact

## Testing Checklist

### Anvil GUI (Reverted)
- [ ] Place two items → Preview shown
- [ ] Click preview → Confirmation message
- [ ] Click again → Items consumed, result appears instantly
- [ ] Take result → Success
- [ ] Close GUI → Inputs returned
- [ ] No duplication exploit
- [ ] No glass pane items given
- [ ] Title check prevents EnchantmentGUIListener interference

### Enchantment GUI (Unchanged)
- [ ] Animation still works
- [ ] Skip animation on click
- [ ] Skip animation on close
- [ ] No glass pane duplication
- [ ] Title check prevents AnvilGUIListener interference

## Commit Information

**Branch**: master
**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/server/enchantments/listeners/AnvilGUIListener.java` (reverted + title check kept)
- `src/main/java/com/server/enchantments/listeners/EnchantmentGUIListener.java` (no changes)

**Summary**: Reverted animation features from Anvil GUI while keeping Enchantment GUI animations intact. Kept title check fixes in both listeners to prevent GUI conflicts.
