# Island Protection & Member Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Island Protection System
**Problem**: Players could destroy each other's islands (no permission checks)

**Solution**: Created `IslandProtectionListener.java` that:
- Prevents unauthorized block breaking
- Prevents unauthorized block placement
- Prevents unauthorized container/block interactions (chests, furnaces, etc.)
- Prevents unauthorized entity damage
- Only allows island owner and members (MEMBER role or higher) to build/interact

**Protected Actions**:
- Block breaking
- Block placing
- Container opening (chests, barrels, furnaces, etc.)
- Crafting table/anvil/enchanting table usage
- Entity attacking (mobs, animals)

**Permission Levels**:
- **Owner**: Full access
- **Members (MEMBER+)**: Can build, break, and interact
- **Non-members**: Cannot do anything

### 2. Member Not Being Added to Island
**Problem**: When players accepted island invitations, they weren't actually added to the island

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- Added debug logging to trace the accept invite flow
- Database save operations are asynchronous but properly waited with `.join()`
- The issue is likely timing or the `/island home` command not checking membership properly

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Updated `/island home` Command
Changed from checking only island ownership to checking full membership:
```java
// OLD: Only checked if player owns an island
islandManager.teleportToIsland(player, player.getUniqueId())

// NEW: Checks if player is owner OR member
islandManager.getPlayerIslandId(player.getUniqueId())  // Returns island they own OR are member of
```

#### B. Added Debug Logging
- `IslandDataManager.saveMember()` - Logs when member is saved to database
- `IslandManager.acceptInvite()` - Logs each step of the accept process
- This will help identify exactly where the issue occurs

## Files Modified

1. **IslandProtectionListener.java** (NEW)
   - Complete protection system for islands
   - Checks permissions for all build/interact actions
   - Registered in Main.java

2. **IslandCommand.java**
   - Updated `handleIslandHome()` to use `getPlayerIslandId()` instead of just owner check
   - Now properly supports members teleporting to their island

3. **IslandDataManager.java**
   - Added debug logging to `saveMember()` method
   - Logs: player UUID, island ID, role, and rows affected

4. **IslandManager.java**
   - Added debug logging to `acceptInvite()` method
   - Logs: acceptance start, membership check, member addition, completion

5. **Main.java**
   - Registered `IslandProtectionListener`

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Island Protection
1. Player A creates an island
2. Player B tries to break/place blocks on Player A's island
3. **Expected**: Player B should be blocked with error message
4. Player A invites Player B: `/island invite <PlayerB>`
5. Player B accepts: `/island accept`
6. Player B should now be able to build on Player A's island

### Test 2: Member Addition
1. Check server console/logs when Player B uses `/island accept`
2. Look for these debug messages:
   ```
   [Island] Player <UUID> accepting invite to island <UUID>
   [Island] Player has membership: false
   [Island] Adding player as MEMBER...
   [Island] Saved member <UUID> to island <UUID> with role MEMBER (rows affected: 1)
   [Island] Player added successfully
   ```
3. Player B uses `/island` or `/island home`
4. **Expected**: Player B should teleport to Player A's island with "Welcome to your island!"

### Test 3: Database Verification
If Player B still can't access the island after accepting:
1. Stop the server
2. Open `plugins/MMO/islands.db` with SQLite browser
3. Check `island_members` table
4. Verify Player B's UUID is listed with:
   - Correct `island_id`
   - `role` = "MEMBER"
   - Valid `added_at` and `last_visit` timestamps

## Expected Debug Output

When a player accepts an invitation, you should see:
```
[Island] Player abc123... accepting invite to island def456...
[Island] Player has membership: false
[Island] Adding player as MEMBER...
[Island] Saved member abc123... to island def456... with role MEMBER (rows affected: 1)
[Island] Player added successfully
```

If "Player has membership: true" appears, the player already owns or is member of another island.

If "rows affected: 0" appears, the database insert failed (check database connection).

## Troubleshooting

### If protection isn't working:
- Verify `IslandProtectionListener` is registered in Main.java
- Check server logs for any errors during listener registration
- Test in an island world (world name starts with "island_")

### If members still can't access island:
1. Check debug logs - does the save actually happen?
2. Verify database schema - does `island_members` table exist?
3. Check for SQLite errors in console
4. Manually query database to confirm member was added
5. Try restarting server after accepting invite

### If `/island home` doesn't work for members:
- Check that `getPlayerIslandId()` returns the correct island ID
- Verify island is loaded in cache
- Check teleportation logs for any errors
