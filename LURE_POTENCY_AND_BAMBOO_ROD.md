# Lure Potency Integration & Bamboo Rod Implementation

## Overview
Integrated the **Lure Potency** stat into the equipment stat system, allowing players to gain lure potency bonuses from custom items and armor. Also created the **Bamboo Rod**, the first custom fishing rod item that provides lure potency and combat utility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Stats GUI Enhancement
**File**: `src/main/java/com/server/profiles/gui/StatsGUI.java`

Added lure potency display to the Fishing Stats section:
```java
// Lines 331-354
ChatColor.AQUA + "» " + ChatColor.YELLOW + "Fishing Speed:",
ChatColor.GRAY + "Lure Potency: " + ChatColor.WHITE + stats.getLurePotency(),
ChatColor.GRAY + "Wait Time: " + ChatColor.WHITE + waitTimeStr,  // Calculated dynamically
```

**Features**:
- Displays current lure potency value
- Shows calculated wait time range based on potency (e.g., "5.0-28.0s" at 200 potency)
- Integrated into existing fishing stats item (slot 34)

### 2. Stat Scanning System
**File**: `src/main/java/com/server/profiles/stats/StatScanManager.java`

#### ItemStatBonuses Class (Lines 1806-1809)
Added new fields to track fishing stats from equipment:
```java
int lurePotency = 0;
double fishingFortune = 0;
```

#### Stat Extraction (Lines 808-827)
Enhanced `extractStatsFromItem()` to scan for lure potency:
```java
// Process Fishing Fortune from enchanted lines
double fishingFortuneBonus = extractBaseDoubleStat(cleanLine, "Fishing Fortune:");
if (fishingFortuneBonus > 0) {
    bonuses.fishingFortune += fishingFortuneBonus;
}

// Process Lure Potency from enchanted lines (supports both names)
int lurePotencyBonus = extractBaseIntStat(cleanLine, "Lure Potency:");
if (lurePotencyBonus == 0) {
    lurePotencyBonus = extractBaseIntStat(cleanLine, "Fishing Potency:");
}
if (lurePotencyBonus > 0) {
    bonuses.lurePotency += lurePotencyBonus;
}
```

**Supported Formats**:
- `Lure Potency: +5`
- `Fishing Potency: +5`
- `Lure Potency: +10 (5)` (with enchantment bonuses)

#### Stat Application (Lines 981-988)
Modified `applyBonusesToStats()` to apply fishing stat bonuses:
```java
// Fishing stats
stats.setFishingFortune(stats.getDefaultFishingFortune() + bonuses.fishingFortune);
stats.setLurePotency(stats.getDefaultLurePotency() + bonuses.lurePotency);
```

### 3. Bamboo Rod Custom Item
**File**: `src/main/java/com/server/items/CustomItems.java`

Created `createBambooRod()` method (Lines 518-546):

**Item Properties**:
- **Base Material**: `Material.FISHING_ROD`
- **Custom Model Data**: `240001`
  - `2` = Functional item category
  - `40` = Fishing rod type (new category)
  - `001` = First variant
- **Display Name**: `§a§lBamboo Rod`
- **Rarity**: `BASIC`

**Stats**:
- **Physical Damage**: `+3` (can be used as a weapon)
- **Lure Potency**: `+1` (reduces fishing wait time)

**Lore Features**:
```
§6Passive: §eQuick Cast
§7Reduces fishing wait time and can be used
§7as a makeshift weapon when needed.
```

**Design Notes**:
- Lightweight bamboo construction theme
- Dual-purpose: fishing tool + melee weapon
- First item in the fishing rod category (40XXX model data range)

## Custom Model Data Pattern for Fishing Rods

### New Category: Fishing Rods (40XXX)
Following the existing pattern for custom items:

| Category | Range | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Swords | 210000-219999 | 210001 (Apprentice's Edge) |
| Helmets | 220000-229999 | 220001 (Crown of Magnus) |
| Chestplates | 230000-239999 | 230001 (Wanderer's Weave Chestplate) |
| **Fishing Rods** | **240000-249999** | **240001 (Bamboo Rod)** |

**Pattern**: `2XXYYZ`
- `2` = Functional item
- `XX` = Item category (40 for fishing rods)
- `YY` = Variant number (00-99)
- `Z` = Sub-variant (0-9)

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Wait Time Calculation
The lure potency from equipment is automatically applied to the fishing wait time calculation:

```java
// In PlayerStats.getFishingWaitTime()
int lurePotency = getLurePotency(); // Now includes equipment bonuses
double scaleFactor = Math.log10(Math.min(lurePotency, 500) + 1) / Math.log10(501);
maxWaitSeconds = 100.0 - (95.0 * scaleFactor);
```

**Example Equipment Impact**:
- Default (0 potency): 5-100 seconds
- Bamboo Rod (+1): 5-99 seconds
- Bamboo Rod + Armor (+10): 5-88 seconds
- Full Fishing Set (+50): 5-65 seconds

### Stat Scanning Workflow
1. Player equips Bamboo Rod or fishing gear
2. `StatScanManager` scans all equipped items every 5 ticks
3. Extracts lure potency from item lore (supports both "Lure Potency:" and "Fishing Potency:")
4. Applies bonuses to `PlayerStats`
5. `FishingListener` uses updated lure potency on fishing cast
6. FishHook wait time is set based on total potency

## Testing Checklist

### Equipment Stat Integration
- [ ] Equip Bamboo Rod, verify lure potency increases by +1 in `/stats`
- [ ] Equip Bamboo Rod, verify physical damage increases by +3 in `/stats`
- [ ] Unequip Bamboo Rod, verify stats return to default
- [ ] Verify wait time display updates in fishing stats GUI
- [ ] Test with multiple items providing lure potency (stacking)

### Fishing Functionality
- [ ] Cast fishing line with Bamboo Rod equipped
- [ ] Verify wait time is reduced compared to default
- [ ] Debug message shows correct potency value
- [ ] Catch fish successfully
- [ ] Verify physical damage applies when hitting mobs

### Admin Commands
- [ ] `/adminstats set <player> lurePotency 50` - verify equipment bonus adds on top
- [ ] `/adminstats view <player>` - verify shows both default and total potency
- [ ] `/adminstats default lurePotency` - verify resets to 0

### Item Creation
- [ ] Give Bamboo Rod via `/give @s fishing_rod{CustomModelData:240001}` (if using vanilla command)
- [ ] Verify item displays correct name, lore, and stats
- [ ] Verify custom model data is 240001

## Future Fishing Rod Variants

Using the new 240XXX range, we can create:
- **240002**: Oak Rod (COMMON) - +2 Lure Potency
- **240003**: Birch Rod (UNCOMMON) - +3 Lure Potency, +1 Fishing Fortune
- **240004**: Spruce Rod (UNCOMMON) - +4 Lure Potency, +5% Ice Fishing Bonus
- **240005**: Dark Oak Rod (RARE) - +6 Lure Potency, +2 Fishing Fortune
- **240006**: Jungle Rod (RARE) - +8 Lure Potency, +10% Void Fishing Bonus
- **240007**: Acacia Rod (EPIC) - +10 Lure Potency, +3 Fishing Fortune
- **240008**: Cherry Rod (EPIC) - +12 Lure Potency, +15% Lava Fishing Bonus
- **240009**: Mangrove Rod (LEGENDARY) - +15 Lure Potency, +5 Fishing Fortune
- **240010**: Crystal Rod (MYTHIC) - +25 Lure Potency, +10 Fishing Fortune, Special Ability

## Benefits for Progression

### Early Game
- Bamboo Rod provides first tangible fishing speed improvement
- Physical damage makes it viable for self-defense
- Low barrier to entry (BASIC rarity)

### Mid Game
- Players can stack fishing gear for significant wait time reduction
- Fishing Fortune from rods improves catch quality
- Encourages specialization in fishing skill tree

### End Game
- High-tier rods (240009-240010) enable instant bites
- Combined with armor bonuses, can reach 500 potency cap
- Creates fishing "builds" similar to mining/combat builds

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Stat scanning occurs every 5 ticks (250ms), minimal overhead
- Lore parsing uses optimized regex patterns
- No network overhead (server-side only)

### Compatibility
- Works with existing enchantment system
- Compatible with custom enchantments that add lure potency
- Supports both integer and decimal stat values

### Debug Support
```java
// Enable stats debug mode to see stat scanning
/debug enable STATS

// Enable enchanting debug for detailed lore parsing
/debug enable ENCHANTING
```

## Summary

Players can now improve their fishing efficiency through equipment, not just player stats. The Bamboo Rod introduces a new item category (fishing rods) with a dedicated custom model data range (240XXX). This creates a foundation for a full progression system of fishing rods, similar to existing weapon and tool systems.

The integration is seamless - equip a fishing rod with lure potency, and your fishing wait times automatically improve. The Stats GUI provides clear feedback on the benefits, showing both the potency value and the actual wait time range.
