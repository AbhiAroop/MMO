## üîß Implementation Details

### IslandManager
**Purpose**: Central management for all island operations

**Key Features**:
- Island creation with currency deduction
- Island deletion with world cleanup
- Island loading/unloading with caching
- Teleportation system for players
- Auto-unload inactive islands after 5 minutes
- Member management (add/remove)
- Statistics tracking integration

**Methods**:
- `createIsland()` - Creates new island, deducts cost, generates world
- `deleteIsland()` - Removes island, kicks players, deletes world files
- `loadIsland()` - Loads from cache or database, generates world if needed
- `teleportToIsland()` - Safe teleportation with spawn location
- `visitIsland()` - Visit another player's island with limit checks
- Auto-unload task runs every 1200 ticks (1 minute)

### IslandWorldManager
**Purpose**: World generation and border management

**Current Implementation**: Standard Bukkit API (SlimeWorldManager pending)

**Key Features**:
- Creates isolated worlds for each island
- Generates starting structures based on type:
  - **SKY**: Floating grass platform (11x11) with void below
  - **OCEAN**: Sand island (15x15 diameter) surrounded by water
  - **FOREST**: Grass platform (17x17) with random trees
- World border management (25x25 to 500x500)
- World deletion with recursive folder cleanup

**TODO**: Integrate SlimeWorldManager once dependency is resolved (flow-nbt issue)

- Database persistence
- Colored success/error messages

### IslandCache
**Purpose**: High-performance in-memory caching

**Features**:
- ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety

- Memory-efficient with auto-unload system

## üöß Known Issues & TODO

### SlimeWorldManager Integration
**Issue**: Dependency resolution failure with `com.flowpowered:flow-nbt:2.0.2`

**Workaround Applied**:
- Temporarily commented out SlimeWorldManager dependency in `pom.xml`
- Using standard Bukkit world management
- All code structure ready for SlimeWorldManager integration

**TODO**:
1. Resolve flow-nbt dependency issue
2. Uncomment SlimeWorldManager dependency
3. Un-comment SlimeWorldManager imports in IslandWorldManager
4. Replace standard Bukkit world creation with SlimeWorldManager API
5. Test world generation with SlimeWorldManager

**Benefits of SlimeWorldManager** (when integrated):
- Much smaller world file sizes (slime format)
- Faster world loading/unloading
- Better performance with thousands of islands
- Built-in compression
- Efficient chunk loading

## üí° Design Decisions

### Why Standard Bukkit for Now?
- SlimeWorldManager dependency issue blocking build
- Standard Bukkit provides working foundation
- Easy to swap to SlimeWorldManager later
- All abstraction in IslandWorldManager

### Why SQLite?
- Lightweight and embedded
- No external server needed
- Fast for single-server setups
- Easy to upgrade to MySQL later if needed

### Why CompletableFuture?
- Non-blocking async operations
- Clean composition of operations
- Better than raw callbacks
- Integrates well with Bukkit scheduler

### Why Auto-Unload?
- Memory efficiency with many islands
- Prevents server lag with inactive islands
- 5-minute threshold balances performance and UX
- Players unload = world unloads = clean memory
