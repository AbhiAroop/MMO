# Farming Skill Implementation - Event Listeners Complete

## Session Summary

Successfully implemented the Farming skill event listeners system, completing the core functionality for crop harvesting and planting mechanics.

## ✅ Completed in This Session

### 1. FarmingListener Event Handler
**Location**: `com.server.profiles.skills.events.FarmingListener`

#### Key Features Implemented:

**A. Crop Harvesting (`onCropBreak`)**
- ✅ Validates player has unlocked the crop before allowing harvest
- ✅ Checks if crop is fully grown before awarding XP (no XP for immature crops)
- ✅ Applies Farming Fortune multiplier to drop amounts
- ✅ Awards XP based on crop type (5-10 XP per harvest)
- ✅ Applies XP boost from skill tree nodes
- ✅ Sends clear error messages when harvesting locked crops
- ✅ Skips creative mode players

**B. Crop Planting (`onCropPlant`)**
- ✅ Validates Cultivating is unlocked (requires Harvesting level 10)
- ✅ Checks if player has unlocked the specific crop for planting
- ✅ Awards XP for planting (2-4 XP per plant, 1/3 of harvest XP)
- ✅ Applies XP boost from skill tree nodes
- ✅ Sends clear error messages for locked crops or locked subskill
- ✅ Skips creative mode players

**C. Crop Growth (`onCropGrow`)**
- ✅ Basic listener implemented (placeholder for future growth speed mechanics)
- ✅ Debug logging for crop growth events
- 📝 Note: Growth speed multipliers will be implemented via scheduled tasks later

### 2. Integration with Main Plugin
**Modified**: `com.server.Main`
- ✅ Added `FarmingListener` import
- ✅ Registered `FarmingListener` with Bukkit event system
- ✅ Placed registration right after `MiningListener` for consistency

### 3. Farming Fortune System
**Implementation Details**:
- Uses same formula as Mining Fortune
- 100 fortune = 2x drops guaranteed
- 150 fortune = 2x drops + 50% chance for 3x
- Modifies vanilla drop behavior
- Cancels default event and spawns multiplied items

### 4. Crop Maturity System
**Features**:
- Checks `Ageable` block data for wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroots, nether wart
- Compares current age to maximum age
- Only awards XP for fully grown crops
- Prevents XP farming from breaking immature crops

### 5. Player Feedback System
**Error Messages Implemented**:
- "You need to unlock the ability to harvest [crop] first!"
- "Check your Harvesting skill tree to unlock this crop."
- "You need to reach Harvesting level 10 to unlock Cultivating!"
- "Keep harvesting wheat to level up your Harvesting skill."
- "You need to unlock the ability to plant [crop] first!"
- "Check your Cultivating skill tree to unlock this crop."

## 🎮 Player Experience Flow

### Starting Out (Level 0-10)
1. Player can harvest wheat by default
2. Each fully grown wheat gives 5 XP in Harvesting
3. Player unlocks other crops via Harvesting skill tree
4. Cannot access Cultivating until Harvesting 10

### Mid Game (Level 10+)
1. At Harvesting 10, Cultivating unlocks
2. Player can now plant wheat seeds
3. Planting gives XP (2 XP per wheat seed)
4. Player unlocks other crops for planting via Cultivating tree
5. Both harvesting and planting contribute to progression

### End Game (High Levels)
1. All crops unlocked for both harvesting and planting
2. High Farming Fortune multiplies crop yields
3. XP boosts from skill tree accelerate leveling
4. Efficient farming rotation maximizes XP gains

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Event Priority
- Both harvest and plant listeners use `EventPriority.HIGH`
- Runs before most other plugins
- `ignoreCancelled = true` respects other plugin cancellations

### Performance Optimizations
- Early returns for non-crop blocks
- Creative mode bypass at the start
- Profile/skill lookups cached per event
- Fortune calculation only when needed (fortune > 100)

### Debug Logging
All events log to `DebugSystem.SKILLS`:
- Crop break events with fortune multiplier
- XP awards for harvesting
- Crop plant events
- XP awards for planting
- Crop growth events (for future debugging)

## 🏗️ Build Status

✅ **BUILD SUCCESS** - All code compiles cleanly
- No errors in FarmingListener
- No errors in Main integration
- Successfully built `mmo-0.0.1.jar`
- Artifact copied to server plugins folder

## ⏭️ Next Steps (Future Implementation)

### 1. Skill Tree JSON Files
Create skill tree definitions:
- `farming_skill_tree.json` - Main farming tree with fortune/speed nodes
- `harvesting_skill_tree.json` - Crop unlock nodes for harvesting
- `cultivating_skill_tree.json` - Crop unlock nodes for planting
- Define node positions, costs, requirements, and rewards

### 2. GUI Implementation
- Farming skill menu (similar to Mining)
- Skill tree visualization
- Node upgrade interface
- Progress tracking displays

### 3. Crop Growth Speed System
Options for implementation:
- **Option A**: Scheduled task checking nearby players and applying Bonemeal effect
- **Option B**: Modify BlockGrowEvent with probability based on nearby players' levels
- **Option C**: Per-chunk cached player data for efficient lookups

### 4. Advanced Features (Botany)
- Custom crop types
- Crop breeding mechanics
- Special plant abilities
- Advanced farming automation

### 5. Balancing & Testing
- Test all crop unlocks in both subskills
- Balance XP values for leveling curve
- Test fortune multipliers at various levels
- Validate level 10 gate for Cultivating
- Test skill tree reset functionality

## 💡 Design Highlights

### Progressive Unlock System
- Wheat is the gateway crop (always available)
- Each crop requires deliberate unlocking in skill tree
- Separate unlocks for harvesting vs planting
- Creates meaningful choices in progression paths

### Dual XP Sources
- Harvesting gives primary XP (larger amounts)
- Planting gives secondary XP (smaller amounts)
- Encourages complete farming loop (plant → grow → harvest)
- Rewards active farming over passive collection

### Fortune Integration
- Mirrors Mining Fortune system (familiar to players)
- Percentage-based with guaranteed + chance components
- Makes high-level farming more rewarding
- Doesn't break game balance (starts at 100 fortune for 2x)

### Level Gate Design
- Cultivating locked until Harvesting 10
- Forces players to learn harvesting mechanics first
- Natural progression: collect → plant → optimize
- Prevents rushing to planting without understanding system

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Crop Growth XP**: Not yet implemented - requires player proximity tracking
2. **Auto-Replant**: Skill tree node exists but mechanic not implemented
3. **Growth Speed Multiplier**: Defined in code but not actively applied
4. **Botany Subskill**: Complete stub, no mechanics implemented

These are intentional - implementing core harvest/plant mechanics first before advanced features.

## 🎓 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Wheat Harvesting
1. Join server as new player
2. Plant wheat with bonemeal to full growth
3. Break fully grown wheat
4. Should receive XP in Harvesting
5. Check `/skills` to verify XP gain

### Test 2: Locked Crop Prevention
1. Plant carrots to full growth
2. Attempt to break carrots
3. Should be blocked with error message
4. Unlock carrots in Harvesting skill tree
5. Retry breaking - should now work

### Test 3: Cultivating Unlock
1. With Harvesting below level 10
2. Attempt to plant wheat seeds
3. Should be blocked with "reach Harvesting level 10" message
4. Level up Harvesting to 10 (via /admin skill commands or grinding)
5. Unlock Cultivating in skill tree
6. Retry planting - should now work

### Test 4: Farming Fortune
1. Level up Farming skill to gain fortune
2. Check fortune value in stats
3. Harvest crops and observe drop quantities
4. Compare to vanilla drop amounts
5. Verify multiplier matches fortune value

### Test 5: Skill Tree Reset
1. Unlock several crops in Harvesting
2. Unlock Cultivating and several crops there
3. Reset Harvesting skill tree
4. Verify crops are locked again
5. Verify appropriate messages are shown

## 📈 Performance Notes

- All checks happen only for crop blocks (early return for non-crops)
- Profile lookups use singleton manager (no repeated DB queries)
- Skill tree checks use cached node data
- Fortune only calculated when fortune > 100
- No continuous tasks or timers (all event-driven)

## ✨ Code Quality

- Follows existing codebase patterns (matches MiningListener structure)
- Comprehensive JavaDoc comments
- Debug logging at all key points
- Clear variable names and method organization
- Proper event priority and cancellation handling
- Resource cleanup (no memory leaks)

---

## 🎉 Summary

The Farming skill system is now **functionally complete** for basic harvesting and planting mechanics! Players can:
- Harvest wheat from the start
- Unlock additional crops via skill trees
- Plant crops once Cultivating unlocks at level 10
- Benefit from Farming Fortune multipliers
- Progress through both Harvesting and Cultivating simultaneously

The foundation is solid and ready for skill tree definitions and GUI implementation.
