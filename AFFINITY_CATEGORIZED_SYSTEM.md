# Affinity System Rework - Categorized Affinities

## Overview

The affinity system has been reworked to split elemental affinities into three distinct categories:
- **OFFENSE** (âš”): Affects outgoing damage, debuffs, and offensive proc chances
- **DEFENSE** (ðŸ›¡): Affects damage taken, shields, and defensive procs
- **UTILITY** (âœ¦): Affects non-combat benefits (movement, regeneration, resource management)

## Counter-Mechanic

**Key Rule**: When an attacker's offensive element matches a defender's defensive element, attacks are **LESS EFFECTIVE** (-20% penalty).

**Example**: If you build Fire offense and attack someone with Fire defense, your Fire attacks deal -20% damage.

**Reasoning**: Fighting fire with fire shouldn't be effective. This encourages build diversity and counter-play strategies.

## Hybrid Enchantments

Hybrid enchantments split their affinity contribution 60/40 between their two elements.

### Offensive Hybrid
- **Stormfire** (Fire 60% / Lightning 40%) - Offensive
- **Celestial Surge** (Light 60% / Lightning 40%) - Offensive

### Defensive Hybrid
- **None currently** - Most hybrids are offensive or utility

### Utility Hybrid
- **Mistborne Tempest** (Water 60% / Air 40%) - Utility (movement)
- **Decayroot** (Earth 60% / Shadow 40%) - Offensive (slow/decay)
- **Embershade** (Fire 60% / Shadow 40%) - Offensive

## Combat Calculations

### Damage Modifier Formula

```
Base Modifier = MAX_DAMAGE_MODIFIER Ã— tanh(RelativeAffinity / 50)
RelativeAffinity = Attacker Offense - Defender Defense

Counter Penalty = -20% if Defender Defense >= 20
Final Modifier = Base Modifier + Counter Penalty
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: Fire vs Fire (Counter-Mechanic)
- Attacker: Fire Offense = 50
- Defender: Fire Defense = 30
- Relative Affinity = 50 - 30 = +20
- Base Modifier = 0.25 Ã— tanh(20/50) = 0.25 Ã— 0.379 = +9.5%
- Counter Penalty = -20% (defender has Fire defense >= 20)
- **Final Modifier = +9.5% - 20% = -10.5% (0.895x damage)**
- Result: Despite having higher affinity, the attacker deals LESS damage due to counter-mechanic

#### Example 2: Fire vs Water (No Counter)
- Attacker: Fire Offense = 50
- Defender: Water Defense = 30
- Relative Affinity = 50 (attacker Fire) vs 0 (defender has no Fire defense)
- Base Modifier = 0.25 Ã— tanh(50/50) = 0.25 Ã— 0.761 = +19%
- Counter Penalty = 0% (different elements)
- **Final Modifier = +19% (1.19x damage)**
- Result: Strong advantage because defender has no Fire defense

#### Example 3: Fire vs Fire (Low Defense)
- Attacker: Fire Offense = 50
- Defender: Fire Defense = 10 (below threshold)
- Relative Affinity = 50 - 10 = +40
- Base Modifier = 0.25 Ã— tanh(40/50) = 0.25 Ã— 0.655 = +16.4%
- Counter Penalty = 0% (defense below 20 threshold)
- **Final Modifier = +16.4% (1.164x damage)**
- Result: No counter-mechanic because defender's Fire defense is too low

## Build Strategy Implications

### Offensive Builds
- **Focus**: Stack ONE offensive element (e.g., all Fire offense)
- **Strength**: Maximum damage against enemies without that element's defense
- **Weakness**: Weak against counter-builds (enemies with matching defensive element)
- **Counter-Play**: Carry hybrid enchantments for backup damage types

### Defensive Builds
- **Focus**: Stack defensive affinity in common offensive elements
- **Strength**: Reduce damage from popular attack types via counter-mechanic
- **Weakness**: Lower offensive pressure
- **Counter-Play**: Mix defensive enchantments across multiple elements

### Balanced Builds
- **Focus**: Split between offense and defense in same element
- **Strength**: Can both deal and resist damage in chosen element
- **Weakness**: Lower peak values in either category
- **Counter-Play**: Most versatile in varied matchups

### Hybrid Builds
- **Focus**: Use hybrid enchantments for multi-element coverage
- **Strength**: Hard to counter, flexible damage types
- **Weakness**: Lower individual element affinity values
- **Counter-Play**: Good against specialized builds

## Display in Stats GUI

The StatsGUI now shows three sections:

```
=== âš” OFFENSIVE AFFINITY ===
ðŸ”¥ Fire: 50
âš¡ Lightning: 20
ðŸŒŠ Water: 0
... (all 8 elements)

=== ðŸ›¡ DEFENSIVE AFFINITY ===
ðŸ”¥ Fire: 10
ðŸ’§ Water: 30
... (all 8 elements)

=== âœ¦ UTILITY AFFINITY ===
ðŸŒ€ Air: 20
ðŸŒ‘ Shadow: 15
... (all 8 elements)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **AffinityCategory.java** - New enum (OFFENSE, DEFENSE, UTILITY)
2. **CategorizedAffinity.java** - Data class holding split affinity values
3. **CustomEnchantment.java** - Added category methods:
   - `getPrimaryAffinityCategory()`
   - `getOffensiveAffinityContribution()`
   - `getDefensiveAffinityContribution()`
   - `getUtilityAffinityContribution()`
4. **AffinityModifier.java** - Updated to use categorized affinity + counter-mechanic
5. **PlayerStats.java** - Added `CategorizedAffinity categorizedAffinity` field
6. **StatScanManager.java** - Updated to scan and track categorized affinity
7. **StatsGUI.java** - Display split into three sections

### Backwards Compatibility
- Legacy `ElementalAffinity` system still exists alongside new system
- Both are calculated simultaneously during equipment scans
- Can be removed after full migration

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify categorized affinity calculation in StatScanManager
- [ ] Check StatsGUI displays all three categories
- [ ] Test counter-mechanic: Fire offense vs Fire defense
- [ ] Test normal advantage: Fire offense vs Water defense
- [ ] Test hybrid enchantments split affinity correctly (60/40)
- [ ] Verify utility affinity doesn't affect damage calculations
- [ ] Test threshold: counter-mechanic only applies if defense >= 20
- [ ] Verify multiple enchantments stack correctly
- [ ] Test affinity updates in real-time when equipment changes
