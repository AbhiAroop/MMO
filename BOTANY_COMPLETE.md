   - Farming Fortune applies (similar to ore fortune)
   - Seed drop chance: 15% (Common) → 2% (Mythic)
   - XP rewards: 15-500 XP based on rarity

4. **Planting**:
   - Right-click farmland with custom crop seed
   - Level requirement check (blocks planting if too low)
   - XP reward: 10-300 XP based on rarity
   - Seed consumed from inventory (except Creative mode)

### Breeding System
1. **Multiblock Structure**:
   ```
   [F] [F] [F]
   [F] [C] [F]  (F = Farmland, C = Composter)
   [F] [F] [F]
   ```

2. **Breeding Process**:
   - Place two parent crop seeds in composter (shift+right-click, then right-click)
   - Breeding time: 1-5 minutes based on rarity
   - Success rates: 60% → 40% → 30% → 20% → 10%
   - Visual: Floating parent crop displays above structure
   - Particles: HAPPY_VILLAGER during, TOTEM_OF_UNDYING on success

3. **Breeding Recipes**:
   - Golden Wheat + Golden Wheat = Crimson Carrot (60%)
   - Crimson Carrot + Crimson Carrot = Ender Berry (40%)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Block System
- **Collision**: Material.TRIPWIRE (invisible, has hitbox)
- **Visuals**: ItemDisplay entity with custom model data
- **Reason**: Tripwire provides block presence without visuals, ItemDisplay handles all visual rendering
- **Not Using**: Tripwire block states (not needed, ItemDisplay handles everything)

### Entity System
- **Type**: ItemDisplay (1.19.4+)
- **Properties**: Invulnerable, Persistent, Billboard.FIXED
- **Transformation**: Scale 0.8, Translation Y-0.4
- **Updates**: Custom model data changes per growth stage

### Performance
- **Growth Checks**: Every 5 seconds (100 ticks), not per-tick
- **Breeder Checks**: Every 1 second (20 ticks)
- **Maps**: O(1) lookup by UUID or Location
- **Cleanup**: Entities removed on crop removal, tasks cancelled on shutdown

### Integration
- **XP System**: SkillProgressionManager.addExperience()
- **Level Checks**: PlayerProfile.getSkillData().getSkillLevel()
- **Fortune Bonus**: PlayerStats.getFarmingFortune()
- **Debug Logging**: DebugManager with DebugSystem.SKILLS
