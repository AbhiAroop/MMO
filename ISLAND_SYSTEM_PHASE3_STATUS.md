4. **IslandInfoGUI.java** - GUI for viewing island info
5. **IslandGUIListener.java** - Handles all GUI click events

### Plugin Integration

- âœ… IslandManager initialized in Main.java
- âœ… GUI listener registered
- âœ… Tab completion implemented

## Compilation Errors to Fix

### 1. Method Name Mismatches
**Problem**: Method names don't match PlayerIsland class
- Used: `getRedstoneLevel()` â†’ Correct: `getRedstoneLimitLevel()`
- Used: `getRedstoneUpgradeCost()` â†’ Correct: `getRedstoneLimitUpgradeCost()`
- Used: `getOwnerUUID()` â†’ Correct: `getOwnerUuid()` (lowercase 'u')

### 2. IslandUpgradeManager Method Signatures
**Problem**: Upgrade methods expect Player, not (PlayerIsland, UUID)
- Need to check actual method signatures in IslandUpgradeManager
- May need to pass Player object instead

### 3. UpgradeResult Enum Values
**Problem**: Using wrong enum values
- Used: `SUCCESS` â†’ Need to check actual enum name
- Used: `MAX_LEVEL`, `NOT_ENOUGH_CURRENCY`, `NOT_OWNER` â†’ verify names

### 4. Switch Pattern Matching
**Problem**: Java 8 doesn't support pattern matching in switch
- Need to use traditional switch or if-else

### 5. IslandUpgradeManager Constructor
**Problem**: Constructor mismatch
- Expected: `(JavaPlugin, IslandManager)`
- Provided: `(IslandManager)`

### 6. Type Conversions
- UUID â†’ Player conversion issue in IslandCreateGUI
- long â†’ int conversions in Island InfoGUI for statistics

### 7. Missing Statistics Getter
**Problem**: PlayerIsland doesn't have `getStatistics()` method
- Need to add this method or access statistics differently

---

## Required Fixes (Priority Order)

### HIGH Priority
1. Check IslandUpgradeManager actual method signatures
2. Fix UpgradeResult enum value names
3. Add getStatistics() method to PlayerIsland OR use alternative approach
4. Fix IslandUpgradeManager constructor call

### MEDIUM Priority  
5. Fix method name mismatches (getRedstoneLevel â†’ getRedstoneLimitLevel)
6. Fix switch statement to Java 8 compatible syntax
7. Fix UUID to Player conversion in teleport call

### LOW Priority
8. Fix long to int casts for statistics (use proper formatting)
