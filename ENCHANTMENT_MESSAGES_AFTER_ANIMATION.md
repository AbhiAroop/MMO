# Enchantment Messages After Animation - Implementation

## Overview
Modified the enchantment GUI animation system so that success messages are only shown **after the animation completes** rather than immediately when the enchantment button is clicked.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. GUIAnimationHandler.java - Message Storage

#### Added Success Message Storage
Added a `successMessage` field to the `AnimationState` class to store the enchantment result message:

```java
private static class AnimationState extends BukkitRunnable {
    private final Player player;
    private final Inventory inventory;
    private final int slot;
    private final ItemStack resultItem;
    private final String successMessage; // NEW: Store success message
    private final Runnable onComplete;
    private int ticksElapsed = 0;
    private boolean completed = false;
    
    public AnimationState(Player player, Inventory inventory, int slot, 
                        ItemStack resultItem, String successMessage, Runnable onComplete) {
        // ... constructor now accepts successMessage
    }
}
```

#### Added Overloaded Method
Created an overloaded `startAnimation()` method that accepts an optional success message:

```java
// Original method (for backward compatibility)
public static void startAnimation(Player player, Inventory inventory, int slot, 
                                 ItemStack resultItem, Runnable onComplete)

// New method with success message
public static void startAnimation(Player player, Inventory inventory, int slot, 
                                 ItemStack resultItem, String successMessage, Runnable onComplete)
```

#### Added Message Retrieval Method
Added a method to retrieve the stored success message before cancelling the animation:

```java
/**
 * Gets the stored success message for a player's animation.
 * 
 * @param player The player whose message to get
 * @return The success message if available, null otherwise
 */
public static String getSuccessMessage(Player player) {
    AnimationState state = activeAnimations.get(player.getUniqueId());
    if (state != null) {
        return state.successMessage;
    }
    return null;
}
```

### 2. EnchantmentGUIListener.java - Message Timing

#### Modified handleEnchantment() Method

**Before**:
```java
if (result.isSuccess()) {
    // Success!
    player.sendMessage(result.getMessage()); // ❌ Message shown immediately
    
    // Clear input slots
    gui.clearInputs();
    
    // Start animation
    GUIAnimationHandler.startAnimation(/* ... */);
}
```

**After**:
```java
if (result.isSuccess()) {
    // Clear input slots (item and fragments consumed)
    gui.clearInputs();
    
    // Store the success message to show after animation
    final String successMessage = result.getMessage();
    
    // Start animation with success message
    GUIAnimationHandler.startAnimation(
        player, 
        gui.getInventory(), 
        EnchantmentTableGUI.OUTPUT_SLOT,
        result.getEnchantedItem(),
        successMessage, // ✅ Pass message to handler
        () -> {
            // Animation complete callback
            // ✅ Show success message AFTER animation
            player.sendMessage(successMessage);
            
            // Sync GUI state after animation
            org.bukkit.Bukkit.getScheduler().runTaskLater(Main.getInstance(), () -> {
                gui.syncWithInventory();
            }, 1L);
        }
    );
}
```

#### Modified onInventoryClose() Method

**Before**:
```java
ItemStack animationResult = GUIAnimationHandler.cancelAnimation(player);
if (animationResult != null) {
    // Give result to player
    // ...
    player.sendMessage(ChatColor.GREEN + "✓ Enchanted item added to inventory (animation skipped).");
}
```

**After**:
```java
// ✅ Retrieve stored success message BEFORE cancelling
String successMessage = GUIAnimationHandler.getSuccessMessage(player);
ItemStack animationResult = GUIAnimationHandler.cancelAnimation(player);
if (animationResult != null) {
    // Give result to player
    // ...
    player.sendMessage(ChatColor.GREEN + "✓ Enchanted item added to inventory (animation skipped).");
    
    // ✅ Show the original success message if available
    if (successMessage != null) {
        player.sendMessage(successMessage);
    }
}
```

## Behavior Changes

### Scenario 1: Wait for Animation to Complete

**Timeline**:
1. Player clicks "Enchant" button
2. Input items consumed immediately
3. Animation starts (2 seconds)
4. Colored glass panes cycle
5. Progress bar, sounds, particles play
6. **After 2 seconds: Success message displayed**
7. Enchanted item appears in output slot

**Messages Shown**:
```
[After animation completes]
✓ Successfully enchanted Diamond Sword!
  + Sharpness III [Physical]
  + Fire Aspect II [Fire]
```

---

### Scenario 2: Skip Animation by Clicking Output

**Timeline**:
1. Player clicks "Enchant" button
2. Animation starts
3. Player clicks output slot during animation
4. Animation skips immediately
5. **Success message displayed immediately**
6. Enchanted item appears in output slot

**Messages Shown**:
```
[Immediately on skip]
✦ Animation skipped!
✓ Successfully enchanted Diamond Sword!
  + Sharpness III [Physical]
  + Fire Aspect II [Fire]
```

---

### Scenario 3: Close GUI During Animation

**Timeline**:
1. Player clicks "Enchant" button
2. Animation starts
3. Player closes GUI (Esc/E)
4. Animation cancelled
5. Enchanted item added to inventory
6. **Success message displayed**

**Messages Shown**:
```
[On GUI close]
✓ Enchanted item added to inventory (animation skipped).
✓ Successfully enchanted Diamond Sword!
  + Sharpness III [Physical]
  + Fire Aspect II [Fire]
Enchantment altar closed. Items returned.
```

## Technical Details

### Message Flow

```
handleEnchantment()
    ↓
Store successMessage as final variable
    ↓
Pass to GUIAnimationHandler.startAnimation()
    ↓
Stored in AnimationState.successMessage
    ↓
    ├─→ Animation Completes Normally
    │       ↓
    │   onComplete callback runs
    │       ↓
    │   player.sendMessage(successMessage)
    │
    └─→ Animation Cancelled (GUI Close)
            ↓
        getSuccessMessage() retrieves message
            ↓
        cancelAnimation() removes state
            ↓
        player.sendMessage(successMessage)
```

### Thread Safety

- Success message captured as `final` variable in callback closure
- Message stored in `AnimationState` for retrieval
- Retrieved BEFORE cancelling animation to avoid race condition
- All operations on main server thread (Bukkit scheduler)

### Memory Management

- Message stored as String reference (minimal memory)
- Cleaned up when animation completes or is cancelled
- No memory leaks from disconnected players (checked in animation loop)

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Dramatic Reveal**
Players see the success message as the enchanted item appears, creating a more satisfying reveal moment.

### 2. **Builds Anticipation**
The 2-second animation builds suspense before the success is confirmed.

### 3. **Consistent Experience**
Messages always appear with the result, whether animation completes or is skipped.

### 4. **Proper Context**
Success message appears alongside the enchanted item, making the connection clear.

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Player Disconnects During Animation
- Animation cancelled automatically
- No lingering state or memory leaks
- No messages sent (player offline)

### 2. Player Closes GUI During Animation
- Success message retrieved before cancellation
- Both skip message and success message shown
- Item added to inventory with full context

### 3. Player Clicks Output During Animation
- Animation skips immediately
- Skip message shown first
- Success message shown immediately after
- Item appears instantly

### 4. Inventory Full on GUI Close
- Warning message shown about drop
- Success message still displayed
- Player knows what item was created

- [ ] Item appears with message
- [ ] No message shown during animation

### Skip by Click
- [ ] Click enchant → Click output during animation
- [ ] "Animation skipped!" message shown
- [ ] Success message shown immediately after
- [ ] Item appears instantly

### Skip by Close
- [ ] Click enchant → Close GUI during animation
- [ ] "Enchanted item added to inventory" message shown
- [ ] Original success message shown
- [ ] "Enchantment altar closed" message shown
- [ ] Item in inventory

### Inventory Full
- [ ] Click enchant → Close GUI with full inventory
- [ ] Warning about drop shown
- [ ] Success message still shown
- [ ] Item dropped on ground

### Failed Enchantment
- [ ] Attempt enchantment that fails
- [ ] Failure message shown immediately (no animation)
- [ ] No changes to this behavior

## Compilation Status

✅ **No compilation errors**
⚠️ **Only warnings** (null checks on player.getLocation() - non-critical)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Message Animation**: Fade in or type-writer effect for messages
2. **Sound Cues**: Different sounds for different message types
3. **Title/Subtitle**: Show success as title text for more drama
4. **Particle Colors**: Match particle colors to message content

---

## Summary

This implementation ensures that enchantment success messages are only displayed **after the animation completes**, creating a more cohesive and dramatic experience. The system properly handles all edge cases including animation skipping and GUI closing, ensuring players always see the appropriate messages at the right time.

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Success messages delayed until animation completes
- ✅ Messages shown when animation is skipped
- ✅ Messages shown when GUI is closed during animation
- ✅ No changes to failure message timing (immediate)
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing code
